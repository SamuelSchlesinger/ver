# ver(sion control)

I wanted to use the teeny cmd framework I made to develop a small application that I might find 
useful. I've always admired git and I'm planning to mimic much of the functionality. Only 
will work on Posix systems because of how I handled the file paths. Shouldn't too hard to fix, 
so if you're a Windows user and you'd like to run the code, let me know and I'll make it more general.

To build, run "make" and the executable will float up from the dist to the top directory. If you're
a Haskell purist you can just cabal build or whatever.

The usage will be generated automatically and printed if you attempt to use it (see cmd).

Currently having an unreasonably tough time pushing files to archive in snap. I'm going to work on that some more tomorrow, but give it a rest for now.
